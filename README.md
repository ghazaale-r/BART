BART ( Cognitive assessment tests -> Decision making -> Risky decision making )

The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized measure of risk-taking behavior. Each click on "pump" causes the balloon to incrementally inflate and money to be added to a counter up until some threshold, at which point the balloon is overinflated and explodes. If push the "collect" button, the score or money will save and the new ballon appears. This happens 10 times in the current version.
